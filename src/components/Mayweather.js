      <h2>Business Lessons from Floyd Mayweather</h2>
      <br></br>
      <i>April 2020</i>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      What is Floyd Mayweather’s legacy? Certainly, he will be remembered as one
      of the greatest boxers of all time. But there is more to be drawn from his
      pioneering career, in particular the lessons for startups embedded within
      his success.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather first hung up his gloves in September 2015 with
      an unblemished 49-0 record. He then famously returned to the ring for a
      one-off bout against Conor McGregor, rounding up his win tally to 50. It
      was an illustrious career that saw Mayweather’s fight against Manny
      Pacquiao become the highest grossing Pay Per View (PPV) event of all time.
      In fact, the four highest grossing boxing fights of all time involved
      Floyd Mayweather.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Mayweather was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan and like many of the boxing
      greats he had a tumultuous upbringing. In interviews he talks of mainly
      raising himself; his older sister ensured that he got up for school. When
      the former boxer speaks of heating water on the stove to wash, the stench
      of urine filling his building and having only one pair of shoes, the
      financial hardship is palpable.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The 1996 Olympics in Atlanta saw Mayweather win a bronze medal following a
      controversial semi-final defeat. He then turned pro in October of 1996 and
      it wasn’t long before his career seemed destined for boxing’s Hall of
      Fame. Mayweather’s defining moment came when he defeated Oscar De La Hoya
      at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas in 2007. The fight not only won him the WBC
      light middleweight title, but also elevated him to global superstardom.
      His combination of talent, work ethic and flamboyance saw his career
      explode, and by the end of 2019, he was crowned the highest earning
      athlete for the decade. Mayweather earnt a staggering $915 million in 10
      years despite on average fighting once a year.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Though Mayweather’s skill as a boxer has been well publicised, what is
      less explored is how he became such an effective entrepreneur. How did
      Floyd Mayweather become boxing’s first $1 Billion Fighter and what are the
      lessons that can be learnt by startups?
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Product</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      What was Floyd Mayweather’s product? What was he selling? One can argue
      that primarily, his product was his fights which were sold to fans. His
      revenue was his split of PPV and ticket sales. In the startup world, most
      people will agree the product is fundamental to success. Companies such as
      Apple have incredible products determined in large part by their founder’s
      obsessive nature. As venture capitalist Peter Thiel wrote in his book
      ‘Zero to One’, “anyone who has held an iDevice or a smoothly machined
      MacBook has felt the result of Steve Jobs’s obsession with visual and
      experimental perfection.”
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Just like Steve Jobs, Mayweather had a tunnel-vision focus on his product.
      He was a relentless trainer, gaining a reputation for his unparalleled
      work ethic. Fight camps would normally consist of three training sessions
      per day with runs taking place at around 3am (Mayweather became nocturnal
      in fight camp). He would spar opponents in the ‘Dog House’ until the
      opponent quit. It was this obsession with being the best fighter that
      enabled him to become the top pound-for-pound boxer in the world, a
      position he retained until his retirement.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Mayweather turned his fights into glamorous but polarising spectacles. His
      ring walk companions included pop music superstars such as Justin Bieber,
      50 Cent and Lil’ Wayne. He even walked into the ring wearing a sombrero to
      antagonise Mexican opponent, De La Hoya. The MGM arena was filled with
      celebrities for Mayweather fights, appealing to people’s attraction to
      glamour. This strategy reached its climax in 2017 when Mayweather fought
      Conor McGregor (a UFC fighter) in a boxing ring; this will likely be
      remembered as one of sport’s most unprecedented events. In summary, the
      combination of being the best fighter and putting on the best shows
      created an unbeatable product.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Sales</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Having a product that people love is one thing, but getting people to buy
      it is just as important. When Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer were building
      Microsoft, their product launches were high-octane. The Windows 95 launch
      saw Gates and Ballmer dance on stage as an exuberant audience watched on.
      <br></br>
      Mayweather understood selling and ruthlessly executed key strategies. His
      brand was built around him playing the pantomime villain. Mayweather
      thrived in this role and he knew it meant people wanted him to lose: “I
      don’t care if you like me or you hate me, as long as you pay to watch me.”
      By antagonising people and stirring up negative emotion, his fights
      generated a greater number of sales than they otherwise would have done.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Relating to the role of the villain, he pulled stunts in the lead up to
      fights to attract attention. If he had a fight approaching, he wanted
      everyone to know about it. He wore a Manchester United shirt to a press
      conference in the build up to his fight against Ricky Hatton, a staunch
      supporter of rival club, Manchester City. He also posted videos online of
      him counting cash with the expectation that they would ‘go viral’.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The hype surrounding Mayweather's fight against De La Hoya saw the debut
      of an original HBO series entitled De La Hoya-Mayweather 24/7. It was a
      show documenting the lead up to the fight that provided viewers with an
      ‘all-access’ look into the fighters’ preparations. Its success meant that
      this became a consistent feature for all future Mayweather fights and
      provided him with another platform to market his fights. The series
      leading up to Mayweather’s rematch against Marcos Maidana saw him befriend
      Warren Buffet. One episode captured a speck of blood on Buffet’s shirt
      after a ringside viewing of a sparring session. As any startup investor
      can attest to, acquiring customers cheaply is a crucial metric in
      determining success. Mayweather’s product and ability to acquire customers
      cheaply made him unstoppable.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>People</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Great entrepreneurs generally surround themselves with great people. Steve
      Jobs once remarked: “it doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell
      them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do”.
      When Mayweather joined forces with Harvard educated Al Haymon back in
      2006, this was a game changer. By this point, Al Haymon had forged an
      impressive reputation in the music promotion industry and was now gaining
      a foothold in the boxing industry. “Me and Al Haymon joined forces because
      he saw not just a fighter, but a person—very articulate and smart inside
      and out of the ring,” The synergy between sports star and manager was key
      to Mayweather’s dominance of boxing over the next decade.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Integration & expansion</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      With Al Haymon on board, Mayweather exercised a provision in his existing
      promotional contract, enabling him to become a free agent for the price of
      $750,000. This paved the way for the creation of ‘Mayweather promotions’ -
      a vertical integration into the promotional business where Mayweather
      would effectively sign broadcasting deals, book venues, hire opponents and
      cover all expenses. This also provided a form of diversification in that
      it wasn’t linked to Mayweather’s physical prowess. Further diversification
      included the creation of a clothing brand and more controversially a strip
      club chain. The most successful businesses rarely focus on one thing -
      Amazon began as an online book store before becoming the ‘everything
      store.’ They now provide web services, online streaming and Alexa. Like
      Bezos, Mayweather dominated one market and then expanded into others.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Despite mastering these four areas of entrepreneurship, Mayweather isn’t
      portrayed as a business mastermind by the mainstream media or the
      educational establishment. Sir Alex Ferguson, another of sports’ towering
      figures, was invited to teach a course at Harvard Business School. It is
      unlikely that a similar invite would be extended to Floyd Mayweather.
      Irrespective of this, Mayweather is a phenomenal strategist whose career
      can provide valuable lessons for startups.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      There’s one entrepreneur I haven’t mentioned who possesses striking
      similarities: Elon Musk. In terms of product, Musk is obsessively working
      towards making the first vehicle that is both electric and truly
      autonomous. ie. the most superior modern car. The Cybertruck, is a
      polarising vehicle but one that ensures people take notice of Musk and his
      companies. In the same vein, Mayweather was comfortable creating a
      polarising product as a means of attracting attention.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      There are also overlaps in their marketing strategies. Musk is happy to
      garner controversy if it means free marketing on a large scale. For
      example, he took a small ‘puff’ on a joint during his podcast interview
      with Joe Rogan; with 31 million views on YouTube, it is now the most
      watched Joe Rogan episode of all time. Additionally, he is able to create
      hysteria around his product launches. He turned the Cybertruck launch into
      a spectacle by throwing a brick at the window (and smashing it). Again,
      the combined views on YouTube are in the tens of millions. Finally, Musk
      leverages his personality to generate a huge amount of publicity. With
      32.5 million followers, Twitter is Musk’s most effective channel to do
      this. The fact that neither Tesla nor SpaceX spend a penny on marketing is
      largely down to Musk’s ability to market at scale. One can see
      similarities here with Mayweather’s ‘All-access’ show as well as his
      pre-fight press conferences. Additionally like Musk now, there was a
      significant proportion of people who wanted Mayweather to fail - this only
      adds to their magnetism.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      In terms of expansion, Tesla vertically integrated in the electric vehicle
      space, building the Giga Nevada, a facility dedicated to battery
      production for the Model 3. This enables Tesla to capture more of the
      value chain while also reducing Tesla’s dependence on external suppliers.
      SpaceX, Starlink and Hyperloop are further Elon Musk projects that
      undoubtedly create valuables synergies. Mayweather may not have sent a
      human-rated spacecraft to space, but he did also dominate one market
      before expanding into others.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      With clear overlaps in the modus operandi of Mayweather and Musk, maybe
      it’s time that entrepreneurs should not only take notice, but study Floyd
      Mayweather’s business career. People may feel that there are flaws in
      Mayweather’s personality (Mayweather spent several months in jail in 2012
      after pleading guilty to misdemeanor assault charges), but how many
      exceptional human beings don’t have flaws?
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Long after Mayweather’s explosive power in the ring faded, his consumer
      base remained. Mayweather’s deep understanding of the customer and his
      ability to build brands are reflected by his astronomical career earnings.
      Though startups and entrepreneurs may not typically turn to Mayweather for
      mentorship, there are many lessons to be learnt from his success.
