      <h2>The Meaning of 'Meaning'</h2>
      <br></br>
      <i>February 2020</i>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      For a long time I’ve thought about exploring the concept of ‘meaning’.
      Luckily I’m not foolish enough to take on this task in its entirety as
      many of the great philosophers have done. I would however like to take a
      shot at exploring the idea of meaning with regard to our working life.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Doing meaningful work isn’t a new idea - yet it seems to be the ambition
      of more and more people. The 80,000 hours movement was created to
      encourage people to “help solve the world’s most pressing problems” - but
      surely this isn’t all there is to it. This article will propose what I
      believe to be the key determinants of meaningful work.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Enjoy</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Can anything else justify doing something that you don’t enjoy? In some
      sense everything else becomes irrelevant. It is difficult to be a happy
      person without enjoying your work. However important enjoyment is though,
      finding enjoyable work can be a significant hurdle for a lot of people
      including myself. So how do we find something that we enjoy? “Learn
      voraciously” is advice form Sam Altman (former Chairman of Y combinator).
      Similarly, Patrick Collison (Stripe CEO) has the following suggestion: “Go
      deep on things. Become an expert” and “aim to read a lot.” It isn’t an
      overnight process but dedication to learning and trying different things
      is the best way to discover what you really enjoy. This is still the case
      if you’re in a job that you don’t like - use it to discover what you do
      and don’t like doing. Could you roll out a new sales process or improve a
      product?
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Excel</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      If you are fortunate enough to have found something you enjoy, then aim to
      excel at it. It’s important to think big but according to Ray Dalio there
      are exceptions, like “playing center on a professional basketball team if
      you’re short, or running a four-minute mile at age 70.” So if you can
      reach the top of a given field, how do you make that happen? Well, working
      hard is important, but so is working smart. Working hard is fairly
      straightforward but how do we work smart? Learning to code, writing or
      building a business can all be aided by books and the internet, to name
      only two resources. The great Warren Buffet also weighs in with some
      advice: “It’s better to hang out with people better than you.” Whatever it
      is that you want to excel at, seek out people who are better than you at
      it.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Purpose</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      You’ve found something that you enjoy, you’re getting pretty good at it,
      but is there a purpose to it? This is where the existential questions kick
      in. Is what I’m doing important? Am I changing things for the better?
      These are anxiety-inducing questions that can be difficult to answer. So
      what’s a healthy way to approach them? Firstly, one can ask: “is my work
      about more than myself?” A second question could be: “is what I’m doing
      having a positive impact on society?.” Developing talent, inspiring others
      and pushing boundaries are all ambitions larger than oneself. Positive
      impact can also come in many forms, some of which may surprise us. For
      example, I happen to believe that Ray Dalio (founder of Bridgewater
      Associates) has had an immensely positive impact on society. Bridgewater
      Associates has created tens of billions of dollars of value for clients
      which include pension funds, charities and university endowments. But what
      if you excel in your job and enjoy it but don’t think it has a real
      purpose? Firstly, you have the option of doing something outside of your
      day job that has a positive impact. Secondly, you can hone your skills and
      build your network before leveraging your experience to change to
      something more purposeful.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Money</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Thinking more about purpose brings us to the elephant in the room, money.
      While money alone can’t give you meaning, it can certainly help you get
      there. Let’s go back to the scenario where you enjoy your job, you excel
      in it but now you add a lucrative pay cheque into the equation. This puts
      you in a fortunate position with a few options. Firstly, you are able to
      save a significant amount of money while looking for a more purposeful
      endeavour. For example, this could be building a Startup to solve a
      problem\*. Once you’ve found a project, you have the financial freedom to
      fully devote yourself to it. Secondly, you can follow the effective
      altruism mantra and donate a certain percentage of your salary to a
      ‘highly effective charity.’
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Doing meaningful work can take time but I think it’s something we should
      all aim for. Not only will it help you achieve success but it will make
      the journey more enjoyable. The sooner you start off in that direction,
      the more success you can achieve.
