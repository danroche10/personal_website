      <h2>How Technology is Changing The Establishment</h2>
      <br></br>
      <i>September 2020</i>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      In as little as twenty years time, much of society will be unrecognisable
      compared to today. Rapid technological change will lead to the replacement
      of decision-makers or gatekeepers in four key segments of our society:
      higher education, media, journalism and politics.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      We can think of technological change in terms of Schumpeter’s creative
      destruction - "the process of industrial mutation that continuously
      revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying
      the old one, incessantly creating a new one." [1]
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      This essay will evaluate how technological change is revolutionising the
      four key segments of society, and how it is consequently “Changing the
      Establishment”.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Education</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <i>“I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.”</i> – Mark
      Twain
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      There are two key things that make higher education ripe for technological
      disruption.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Firstly, higher education has seen a huge increase in price. The graph
      below shows a nearly 200% increase in the price of a US college education
      since 1997 (vs an overall inflation rate of 55.6%). [2]
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <img
        src="/inflation.png"
        className="graph"
        alt=""
        width="400"
        height="514"
      />{" "}
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Second, there has been a decline in relevance of much of higher education
      in relation to the ‘Future of Work’, a term that describes a new
      technology-driven working world. This new working world means more remote
      working, resulting in fewer geographical restrictions for both employers
      and employees. It also menas less defined careers paths, more problems
      being solved using software, and an increased ability for people to
      generate income online. With the above in mind, is a four year degree
      costing >$200,000 the best allocation of time and money?
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The answer to the above requires nuance. Let’s say that for 20% of the
      population, higher education is still relevant. These students primarily
      attend top-tier universities and study technically focused subjects. [3]
      The economic signal is worth the price, and the skills gained are directly
      relevant to many career paths. But what is the best route for the other
      80%? [4]
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Technology will increasingly offer a compelling alternative to higher
      education for this group of people. [5] For a curious and disciplined
      student, the internet represents an infinite and mostly free resource.
      However, even if a student replaces their formal education with internet
      learning, it is still hard to attain an economic signal for the acquired
      skills. The internet is increasingly able to provide this. Aspiring coders
      can build web apps which are visible to the public, students can write
      about any subject of their choice and publish on substack or medium.
      Therefore, a student can learn voraciously and their quality is visible
      through tangible projects. Naturally, students will be on a spectrum with
      some pushing their learning to the limits while others solidify basic
      concepts. Importantly though, opportunity can be unlimited and social
      mobility increased.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      While independent learning is effective and it is possible to showcase
      one’s skill level,we will likely see a movement towards more structured
      forms of internet education. Lambda School in the US offers a nine month
      online software education (with the option of funding it through an income
      sharing agreement). [6] As this sort of education grows in popularity, the
      economic signal will become better understood. LinkedIn co-founder Reid
      Hoffman posed the following question: “what’s the simplest credential that
      everyone is aware of that I could throw on the table that says you have
      some capability of learning, and you’ve been trained in some learning
      institution?” Providing solutions to this question will become an
      increasingly important and lucrative entrepreneurial opportunity.

      <br></br>
      <b>Media</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <i>
        “The day when HBO went to a podcast for exposure. Mark this day people,
        the internet is winning.”
      </i>{" "}
      Youtube comment [7]
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Bill Maher appearing on the Joe Rogan Experience in January 2020 was a
      pivotal movement for internet media. It was a role reversal - Bill Maher
      was promoting the latest series of his HBO talk show on an internet
      podcast.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The way we consume media is changing beyond recognition. Increasingly,
      media is consumed through internet platforms such as: Netflix, Amazon
      Prime, YouTube, Spotify and a plethora of podcasting apps. The internet
      will continue to dominate and so traditional forms of media must adapt or
      face extinction. How will the new media establishment look?
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Consumption will become increasingly fragmented as a result of increased
      choice. Twenty years ago, if you took a random sample of a thousand people
      who consumed media on a given evening, the results would be fairly
      predictable. Now it would be much, much harder.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The centralisation points will primarily be platforms rather than content
      producers. There will clearly be exceptions to this rule. Often more than
      ten million people will watch or listen to The Joe Rogan Experience. But
      for every Joe Rogan, there are tens of thousands of people producing
      content on a more niche subject. We can think of Netflix or Amazon Prime
      in the same way. For every ‘Breaking Bad’, there are hundreds of niche
      shows and documentaries available on the same platform.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The traditional ‘middlemen’ who determined which content made it onto our
      screens are far less important. Any small group of people are able to
      produce content and distribute almost immediately through their chosen
      platform. They are able to build their own brand through social media and
      thus need to sacrifice a lot less freedom.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      It seems likely that the tech companies will dominate the media landscape
      and so there will be a new set of gatekeepers. Joe Rogan believed that the
      YouTube gatekeepers were preventing some of his more controversial content
      from trending. At least partly in response to this, he moved his entire
      podcasting operation to Spotify, who have promised zero interference.
      Although there will remain centralised points of power, it may be that the
      landscape moves away from censorship and towards freedom for content
      producers.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Journalism</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <i>
        “Twitter is not on the masthead of The New York Times. But Twitter has
        become its ultimate editor.”
      </i>{" "}
      Bari Weiss
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Journalism has undergone a huge transformation as a result of
      technological adoption. News has become commoditized and so publications
      are increasingly differentiating themselves through narrative. The rise of
      social media has meant that articles are written with the aim of
      maximising shares on social media. Nuance and objectivity are a lot less
      common.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Where does this leave journalism? Technology is creating exciting
      opportunities for talented writers. Platforms such as Substack and Medium
      mean that anyone can write about any subject and develop a following
      organically. In these instances, there is no editorial control and the
      narrative is not dictated by an institution.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      For readers this means choice, which should raise the bar for writers. For
      any given subject, a reader may have free access to many different
      writers. Therefore, the best writers will keep readers coming back. And
      the best way of ensuring that readers keep coming back? Deliver high
      quality content on a regular basis.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      However we are clearly in a painful transition period where journalism
      continues to face challenges such as misinformation, tribalism and
      algorithm manipulation. There is currently a glut of “quick, shallow, and
      reactive coverage” which is exacerbating societal divisions. [8]
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      It is unclear where journalism will end up, but social media companies,
      artificial intelligence and more ‘slow news’ outlets will all play a
      significant role in overcoming the current challenges.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      What is clear is that there will always be a demand for exceptional
      journalism. Similarly to media, technology means that any writer can
      publish online and build a following without institutional interference.
      As we see more writers take this route, we can hopefully enter a new phase
      of high quality journalism.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Government</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <i>
        “Government is just another sector waiting to be eaten by software.”{" "}
      </i>
      Nicolas Colin [9]
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      While it is true that government is ripe for disruption, there seems to be
      a lack of crossover between technologists and government. This means that
      people in government aren’t aware of the ‘software opportunity’. On the
      other hand, technologists aren’t aware of the entrepreneurial
      opportunities in transforming government.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      It seems likely that this will change. In the UK, Dominic Cummings is a
      radical proponent of using technology to transform ‘systems and
      government.’ This will mean a bigger focus on hiring software engineers,
      data scientists, and the like. The continuation of this trend seems
      inevitable both in the UK and across the world. This will increase the
      overlap between government and technology whereby we see an increase in
      technologists working for the government as well as an increase in
      startups building government-focused products.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      We are going to see a huge increase in government decisions being made
      with the help of technology. Although there will likely be an adjustment
      period, this should result in higher effectiveness, more transparency and
      greater efficiency. Of course, some governments will leverage technology
      better than others and this will increasingly contribute to the progress
      of countries.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      In the long-term, the skills and characteristics that make up an effective
      politician will change. Politicians with a deep understanding of
      technological trends and an ability to harness technology will become more
      important. While it may be a long time before we see a former ‘hacker’
      leading a major country, the political establishment will increasingly
      comprise of people from a technological background. More engineers in
      government should be positive especially in solving complex challenges
      like climate change and automation.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Conclusion</b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Throughout the establishment many of the traditional gatekeepers will
      descend into irrelevance. There will be new gatekeepers who will have a
      deep understanding of technology. As power changes hands, the points of
      centralisation will change.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The most successful societies will create and foster dynamism, innovation
      and entrepreneurship. They will also ensure an adequate safety net as the
      job market changes.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Individuals will increasingly take diverging paths. Those that thrive will
      use technology to learn, grow and ultimately provide value to society. The
      internet has only just begun.
